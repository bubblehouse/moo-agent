# Coverage Targets

Tick `[x]` when you've personally verified the item works. Don't tick from memory or from the bootstrap source — the point of this skill is empirical coverage.

## Movement — canonical opening

- [x] start at **West of House** (after `--reset`, `look` shows "open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door"; **no** "secret path leads southwest" — that mention indicates WON-FLAG is set, which is a bug)
- [x] `open mailbox` → "Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet."
- [x] `take leaflet` → "Taken."
- [x] `read leaflet` → ZORK welcome blurb
- [x] `go north` → **North of House**
- [x] `go east` from North of House → **Behind House**
- [x] `open window` at Behind House (window starts slightly ajar; `open` opens it the rest of the way)
- [x] `go in` (or `go west`) → **Kitchen**
- [x] `go up` from Kitchen → **Attic**
- [x] `take rope` at Attic
- [x] `take knife` at Attic
- [x] `go down` → back to Kitchen
- [x] `go west` → **Living Room**
- [ ] `take sword` / `take lantern` in Living Room (lantern OK; **sword broken** — see BUGS.md class entry)
- [x] `move rug` → reveals **trap door**
- [x] `open trap door` → "rickety staircase descending"
- [x] `light lantern` → lantern lit (well: "It is already on" — lantern starts on by reset)
- [x] `go down` (through trap door) → **Cellar**
- [x] `go north` (with lit lantern) → **Troll Room** (no troll in description until `look` is run twice; troll-related verbs broken)

## Movement — branching paths

- [x] **South of House** via `go south` from West of House
- [x] **Forest Path** via `go north` from North of House
- [x] `go up` (or `climb tree`) at Forest Path → **Up a Tree**
- [x] `take egg` at Up a Tree
- [x] **Clearing** north of Forest Path → grating clearing (move leaves "Done." but grating not revealed; `examine grate` etc. fail — partly known-quirks single-location, but `move leaves` should still update the description)
- [x] **Forest** rooms (Forest 1, 2, 3) — Forest 2 + Mountains visited; clearing's east goes to Forest 2 not Canyon View as canonical expects
- [x] **Canyon View** (east from Clearing) — reachable this run via Behind-House → Clearing → east
- [x] `climb down` at Canyon View → **Rocky Ledge** → **Canyon Bottom** ✓
- [x] `go north` from Canyon Bottom → **End of Rainbow** ✓
- [ ] `wave sceptre` at End of Rainbow — sceptre unreachable (locked behind troll); but `take pot` works without solidifying rainbow, see BUGS.md
- [ ] **Maze** entry from Cellar; visit Maze rooms
- [x] **Coal Mine** descent: Cellar → Troll Room → east → maze → coal mine entrance → squeaky room → bat room (2026-05-17 — route via Slide Room reverse, Squeaky → Bat Room confirmed; jade figurine on basket)
- [x] **Loud Room** — picked up platinum bar after `echo` flipped LOUD-FLAG
- [ ] **Round Room** + **Damp Cave** + **Egyptian Room** + **Treasure Room** routes (Round Room only)
- [x] **Dam** / **Dam Lobby** / **Maintenance Room**: pushed all four buttons, took wrench/screwdriver; turn-bolt-with-wrench fails ("won't turn with your best effort") — see BUGS.md re: bolt gating
- [ ] **Dome Room** via tied rope (climb down rope to Torch Room) — reached Dome Room but no rope (in Attic)

## Verbs — exercise at least once

### Inventory and inspection

- [x] `inventory` (and `i`) — but listing format is broken; see BUGS.md
- [x] `look` (and `l`) — but doesn't list contents; see BUGS.md
- [x] `examine <obj>` — leaflet, window, sack, troll (last is broken)
- [x] `describe <obj>` — **broken**: prints "The lamp is on." regardless of dobj. See BUGS.md.
- [x] `what <obj>` — **broken**: same as `describe`. See BUGS.md.
- [x] `read <obj>` — leaflet works; sword fails gracefully
- [x] `look in <container>` — broken; returns room desc instead. See BUGS.md
- [ ] `look on <surface>`
- [x] `look in <container>` (open sack) — works: `The brown sack contains: A lunch` (improved from "returns room desc")
- [x] `look in <container>` (closed sack) — works: `The brown sack is closed.`
- [x] `examine <container>` (open container) — works: `examine sack` lists contents
- [x] `look in <container>` after opening — still returns room desc (use `examine` instead)

### Manipulation

- [x] `take <obj>` / `get <obj>` — works for normal items; broken for objects with custom take.py (sword, troll)
- [x] `take <obj> from <container>` — works (`take garlic from sack` after putting it in)
- [x] `take all` — now works (lists each item with result; was broken)
- [x] `take all but <obj>` — fixed 2026-05-10: alias-aware exclusion in `dispatch_multi.py`
- [x] `drop <obj>`
- [x] `drop all` — works correctly
- [x] `put <obj> in <container>` — `put X at Y` crashes; see BUGS.md
- [x] `put <obj> in <container>` — `put garlic in sack` works
- [x] bare `put` — fixed 2026-05-10: missing-dobj guard, prints "What do you want to put?"
- [ ] `put <obj> on <surface>`
- [x] `open <obj>` — mailbox, window, sack, trap door
- [x] `close <obj>` — fixed 2026-05-10: no more spurious "pitch black" in lit rooms (is_lit honors `outdoor` flag; zstate_set returns the new value)
- [ ] `unlock <obj> with <key>`
- [x] `turn <obj> with <obj>` — `turn bolt with wrench` returns "The bolt won't turn with your best effort." (canonical if yellow LED not lit; reproduced after pushing yellow — see BUGS.md possible-gating)
- [x] `push <button>` — yellow→Click, blue→leak in maintenance, red→lights on, brown→Click (canonical)
- [x] `push bubble` — "Pushing the green bubble has no effect." (canonical when bolt not turned)
- [x] `lower/raise <obj>` — `lower basket` works once with spurious extra line; second call crashes; see BUGS.md
- [x] `light <obj>` — lantern (already on); leaflet returns helpful canonical hint; `burn leaflet` triggers death + crash
- [x] `extinguish <obj>` / `blow out <obj>` — both work. `turn off <obj>` and `turn <obj> off` fixed 2026-05-10: rewritten to `extinguish` in `do_command.py`
- [x] `move <obj>` — rug
- [ ] `tie <obj> to <obj>` — rope to railing
- [ ] `untie <obj>`
- [ ] `turn <obj> with <obj>` — bolt with wrench
- [ ] `push <button>` — yellow button (Maintenance Room)
- [x] `wave <obj>` — `wave lantern` works ("Fiddling with the brass lantern has no effect."); sceptre at End of Rainbow not tested (rainbow unreachable in this run)
- [ ] `ring <bell>` — brass bell
- [x] `rub <obj>` — `rub lantern` works (fiddling msg); mirror not tested
- [x] `pray` — works anywhere ("If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered."); altar not tested in this run
- [ ] `dig with <tool>` — sand with shovel
- [x] `wind <obj>` — `wind canary` returns "There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary." (canonical for damaged canary)
- [ ] `squeeze through <obj>` — narrow crack

### Combat / NPCs

- [x] `attack <npc> with <weapon>` — **HERO-BLOW long-running loop guard fires**, see BUGS.md
- [x] `kill <npc> with <weapon>` — **same HERO-BLOW abort path**, see BUGS.md
- [x] `<NPC>, <command>` — `troll, give me the axe` also routes through HERO-BLOW and aborts
- [x] `say <word>` — `say hello` returns "There is no 'hello' here." (the verb tries to resolve the word as a dobj; ungraceful)
- [x] bare incantation — `hello` alone returns just `5` (an integer leaked from V-HELLO state); `hi` returns "Good day."; `hello sailor` returns "Nice weather we've been having lately." See BUGS.md
- [ ] `answer "<word>"` — to a creature's question
- [ ] bare answer word — `ulysses` to the cyclops
- [x] `give <obj> to <npc>` — `give garlic to me` no longer leaks "Wizard" (fixed 2026-05-10 via me-target check in substrate attack/pre_drop)
- [x] bare `give <obj>` — fixed 2026-05-10: returns "Give what to whom?" instead of "to a !" garbage
- [x] `drop me` — fixed 2026-05-10: returns "You'd lose your balance." (no more "Wizard" leak)
- [x] `attack me` / `kill me` — fixed 2026-05-10: returns "Trying to attack yourself is a sign of psychic distress."

### Meta

- [x] `score` — works ("Your score is 35 (total of 350 points), in 49 moves. ... Amateur Adventurer.")
- [x] `wait` (or `z`) — works ("Time passes...")
- [x] `again` (or `g`) — **now works** (repeats the previous command)
- [x] `verbose` — works ("Maximum verbosity.")
- [x] `brief` — accepts the command but **doesn't suppress descriptions** on re-entry, see BUGS.md
- [x] `superbrief` — **now accepts** the command (used to require `super_brief`); still doesn't suppress descriptions, see BUGS.md
- [x] `diagnose` — **now works** ("You are in perfect health.")
- [x] `inventory` (already counted above)
- [x] `version` — works; serial number on one line (fixed 2026-05-10 via hand-written `verbs/zork_actor/version.py`)
- [x] `save` / `restore` — return "Failed." (saved-game mechanism not implemented; acceptable)
- [x] `restart` / `quit` — fixed 2026-05-10: `substrate_receiver` overrides now route `score` to `context.player`; `is_yes` predicate hand-written on Zork Actor.

## Failure-mode probes — these MUST fail (failure to fail = bug)

- [x] `go southwest` from West of House before WON-FLAG → tested at South of House (`go southwest`): "You can't go that way." ✓
- [x] `go east` from West of House → "The door is boarded and you can't remove the boards." ✓
- [ ] `examine leaflet` after dropping it in another room → not tested cleanly this run
- [x] `climb walls` at End of Rainbow → "You can't go that way." ✓
- [x] `climb mountains` at Mountains → "The mountains are impassable." ✓
- [ ] step into a dark room without a light source → **cannot test** (always_lit short-circuit, see known-quirks.md)
- [ ] open mailbox already open → "It is already open."
- [x] take object you already have → **failed expectation**: returns "Taken." instead of "You already have it." (see BUGS.md)
- [x] interact with `Wizard` listed in a room → not seen this session (look's contents-listing is broken so we can't tell)
- [x] **invalid verb** (`frobozzle troll`) → "I don't know how to do that." ✓ (graceful, exit 1)
- [x] **take scenery** (`take walls`) → "There is no 'walls' here." ✓ (graceful, exit 1)
- [x] **read non-readable** (`read sword`) → "I don't know how to do that." ✓ (canonical "no message" would be better but this is acceptable)
- [x] **light non-flammable** (`light leaflet`) → "If you wish to burn the leaflet, you should say so." ✓ (excellent canonical hint)
- [x] **invalid prep** (`put X at Y`) → **AttributeError leaked to player**, see BUGS.md
- [x] **xyzzy / plugh** → **now both return** the canonical "A hollow voice says \"Fool.\""
- [x] **compound period-separated** (`drop knife. drop rope`) → not supported, see BUGS.md
- [x] **multi-noun "and"** (`drop sword and leaflet`, `take sword and leaflet`) → **now works** for take/drop; comma still unsupported; `examine X and Y` still treats whole tail as one dobj
- [x] **`burn leaflet`** while held → death sequence triggers but crashes on missing player_start, see BUGS.md

## Treasures — pick up and deposit

The trophy case in Living Room is the score sink. After picking up a treasure, return to Living Room and `put <treasure> in case`. Tick a treasure when both pickup and deposit succeed.
